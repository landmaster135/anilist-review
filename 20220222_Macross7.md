# Long Review

Macross series has three elements. Those are “Song”, “Robot” and “Love Triangle”. This anime Maross 7 has those three elements as well as other Macross anime.

However, Macross 7 has a very different taste from Macross Frontier and the original Macross.
In the other Macross anime, the women presence is stronger. But, in Maross 7, rowdy men glamorize this anime. The battle of __Basara__, the main character in this anime, and the enemy __Guigil__ is the best bout for me. Then, I seriously love Gigile singing very much.

Main characters are members of the rock band “Fire Bomber”. I feel the name “Fire Bomber” is a hilariously uncool and nostalgic and songs sung by “Fire Bomber” is corny but funny, too.

Compared to the original Macross, drawing and modeling of robots are sophisticated. The main Valkyrie Frame in this anime is red and seems to express the passion of Basara. This robot name is __“VF-19 revision Excalibur Nekki-Basara-Special”__ and has the most advanced performance. However, Basara doesn’t use this Excalibur for battle but for delivering his songs. This Excalibur doesn’t fire assault bullets but speakers for delivering his singing voice.

There are also characters from the original Macross. Main character __Mylene__ is their daughter. Mylene is palliative for this manful anime. Basara and Mylene are members of the rock band “Fire Bomber” and always fighting. Basara is very straightforward and inflexible. Mylene is so young and clumsy. They have those characteristics to fight each other every time. However, they are good together when they do a concert. The songs sung during a play by them are comfortable and exciting. I often get goosebumps by direction tacky but not get it in this anime. Personally, the first ending song “MY FRIENDS” is the best.

__Gamlin Kizaki__ is the vertex of the triangle. He is Mylene’ s companion for formal marriage interview. He is so square at the beginning but changes little by little. The growth of him with Basara and Mylene is also noticeable.

Then, __the girl with a flower bouquet__ is also cute and unmissable. I wanna give the Fighting Spirit Prize to her, too. How much longer does she take to talk with Basara and the “Fire Bomber” members? She is so unfortunate but the times of her appearance in this anime are many among all the characters. So, she sits in a subtle position whether a supporting character or a main character. I think she appears to be drawn upskirt…?

After the main story finished, the side stories aired. The side stories are past events, after events and also funny compared to general anime.

Macross 7 brings back memories from my youth. Enjoy.


# Short Review

Rowdy men glamorize this anime.
Mylene and the girl with a flower bouquet are palliative.
But, I love Gigile singing.
